# The Page Builder Journey: Interactive Developer Story

An engaging, interactive educational story that teaches developers how to implement inline editing features for Squiz DXP's Visual Page Builder.

## 🎯 Purpose

This interactive story guides developers through the journey of transforming basic components into powerful, inline-editable Page Builder components. It covers the essential concepts, patterns, and best practices for implementing `data-sq-field` attributes and handling edit mode vs front-end mode rendering.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts
- **Basic to Enhanced Components**: Evolution from simple HTML output to inline-editable components
- **Edit Mode Detection**: Using `isEditor()` utility and context objects
- **Data-sq-field Mapping**: Proper attribute mapping to manifest.json structure
- **Conditional Rendering**: Handling empty states and edit mode placeholders
- **Complex Data Handling**: Arrays, objects, and advanced field types

### Key Patterns
- Standard inline editing implementation
- Conditional logic for edit vs front-end modes
- Array rendering with proper indexing
- Quick options vs inline editing decisions
- Error handling and graceful fallbacks

## 🚀 Features

### Interactive Elements
- **Chapter Navigation**: Progress through 7 chapters of learning
- **Live Code Demos**: Interactive examples showing edit mode vs front-end mode
- **Mode Switching**: Toggle between different rendering modes
- **Tabbed Examples**: Explore manifest, component, and output code
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Click any code example to copy it

### Enhanced Experience
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate chapters
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar showing story completion
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Smooth Animations**: Engaging transitions and hover effects
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden surprises for curious developers
