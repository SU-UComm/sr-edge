    "description": "<p>Stanford design student Tyler Newman has an eye for design and a passion for building and celebrating community.</p><p>And thanks to her work, and the work of the student group known as The Design Kids, the university recently launched <strong><a href='https://resed.stanford.edu/neighborhoods' target='_self'>eight new neighborhood crests</a></strong>, each a reflection of Stanford’s residential communities’ culture and feel.</p><p>“I think it’s such a unique opportunity that our studio has been able to create a system of design that can be used in perpetuity,” Newman said. “Even 100 years from now, I hope they are still relevant and still helping to create and foster community.”</p>",
