        "New research shows adding real-world driving data to battery management software and computer models of battery pack performance can lead to longer-lasting, more reliable batteries.",
        "Lithium metal batteries could double the range of electric vehicles, but current batteries degrade quickly during operation. Stanford researchers have discovered that you can improve the battery’s cycle life simply by letting it rest for several hours in the discharged state.",
        "“Going forward, evaluating new battery chemistries and designs with realistic demand profiles will be really important,” said energy science and engineering postdoctoral scholar Le Xu."
